# DataGridView

## What it does

This custom activity is used to display any kind of data in a Windows Form using a dataGridView. The input is a dataTable and how the screen should be displayed, the output is the new dataTable and the last selected cell.

This could be used to change data, selected cells and transforming unstructured data to structured data with human assistance, by asking the user to select a cell in the column with a certain type of data.

For a small showcase please see:Â [plotTable showcase](https://vimeo.com/286331402)

```

Suffix (optional) - String - The name of the window
